Solution set 1-Python:

1.Write a program that examines three variables—x, y, and z— and prints the largest odd number among them. If none of them are odd, it should print a message to that effect.

a=int(input())
b=int(input())
c=int(input())
list1=[]
max=0
if a%2!=0:
    list1.append(a)
if b%2!=0:
    list1.append(b)
if c%2!=0:
    list1.append(c)
for i in list1:
    if i>max:
        max=i
if max>0:
    print(max)
else:
    print("Enter atleast one odd number")

2.
Python provides a built-in function called len that returns the length of a string, so the value of len('Cigna') is 5. Write a function named right_justify that takes a string named s as a parameter and prints the string with enough leading spaces so that the last letter of the string is in column 70 of the display.


def right_justify(str1):
    print(str1.rjust(70-len(str1)))
str2=str(input())
right_justify(str2)



3.Write a program that asks the user to input 10 integers, and then prints the largest odd number that was entered. If no odd number was entered, it should print a message to that effect.


list1 = []
for i in range(0,10):
    a = int(input("enter the numbers"))
    if a % 2 != 0:
        list1.append(a)
#else:
    
    #print("No Odd Numbers")
print("Max of list : ",max(list1))



4.Practice using the Python interpreter as a calculator:

a) The volume of a sphere with radius r is 4/3pr3. What is the volume of a sphere with radius 5?
Hint: 392.7 is wrong!

b) Suppose the cover price of a book is Rs.24.95, but bookstores get a 40% discount. Shipping costs
Rs.3 for the first copy and 0.75p for each additional copy. What is the total wholesale cost for
60 copies?

c) If I leave my house at 6:52 am and run 1 mile at an easy pace (8:15 per mile), then 3 miles at
tempo (7:12 per mile) and 1 mile at easy pace again, what time do I get home for breakfast?



a)a=int(input("Enter the sphere radius"))
volume=4/3*22/7*pow(a,3)
print(volume)


b)price = float(input("Enter the price")) 
Book_no = int(input("Enter total no of books")) 

totalcost = price*Book_no
discounted_cost = totalcost * (40 / 100)
actual = totalcost - discounted_cost

extra= Book_no - 1
overall = (extra* 0.75) + (actual*3)
print(overall)




5.Write a program that asks the user to enter an integer and prints two integers, root and pwr, such that 0 < pwr < 6 and root**pwr is equal to the integer entered by the user. If no such pair of integers exists, it should print a message to that effect.

a = int(input("Enter a number"))

for i in range(1, 6):
    for j in range(1,10):
        n = j ** i
        if n == a:
            print("root is : ", j, "power is : ", i)


6.
Let s be a string that contains a sequence of decimal numbers separated by commas, e.g., s = '1.23,2.4,3.123'. Write a program that prints the sum of the numbers in s.



s = '1.23,2.4,3.123'
values = s.split(",")
tot= 0
for i in values:
    tot = tot +float(i)
print(tot)


7.

Write a function isIn() that accepts two strings as arguments and returns True if either string occurs anywhere in the other, and False otherwise. Hint: you might want to use the built-in str operation in.

9.
Assume that we execute the following assignment statements: width = 17 height = 12.0 delimiter = '.' For each of the following expressions, write the value of the expression and the type (of the value of the expression).
>>> width/2
>>> width/2.0
>>> height/3
>>> 1 + 2 * 5
>>> delimiter * 5
Use the Python interpreter to check your answers


width=17
height=12.0
delimiter='.'
print(type(width/2))
print(type(width/2.0))
print(type(height/3))
print(type(1+2*5))
print(type(delimiter*5))
