Python 

1: Write program to print multiplication table.

2: Write program to reverse the string [ different options , like using standard function or using loop etc ]

3: Difference between dictionary, list, tuples

4: Write program to count the number of occurrences of chars in a string. Example : str ='aabbccc' o/p 2a2b3c

 

SQL

1: Union vs union all

2: Joins, different joins and some scenarios what join to use.

3: Use of partition , qualify, row_num 

4: Write script to display customer names who not yet watched movies

   Table 1 : Customer 

   Table 2 : Movie list

5: Different key , primary, secondary, foreign , alternate 

 

GIT

1: Different commands and usage of each.







Python
 - reverse a string
 -count the number of consecutive letters
 - lower case/upper case
 - diff between list, dictionary ,tuple
 - wat pandas does
 - program to find given no is right angled triangle
 - virtual environment
 SQL
 - movie customer scenario


 Git
 - all concepts

 Teradata
 - primary index secondary index

 Agile
 - process complete.
